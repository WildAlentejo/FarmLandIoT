Node-red json flow of my offgrid property, I use a raspberry pi and some esp32/8266 that gives me the temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature and soil moisture
and to control some electro valves with relays.

This flow is not working out of the box, needs to be cleaned and some widgets need to be reorganised.

feel free to use it.
